National Integration Adaptor - [GP2GP Requesting Adaptor](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/gp2gp/patient-switching---integration-adaptor)

Incumbent providers (e.g. TPP, EMIS, SystemOne) in order to deploy GP2GP Adaptor in their infrastructure
to support losing practice scenario - i.e. whereby a different practice transfers patient data from the incumbent
would have to make changes to their GP Connect interface implementations.
In particular, they would need to implement 1.6.0 version that is required by the GPC Consumer and GP2GP adaptors.
This business case is not always easy to be accepted by the incumbent providers, as they would have to invest time to make those changes.

The motivation for the Switching Standard Adaptor is to remove the dependency from incumbent providers to do that work.
The idea is to build an adaptor that could be installed and configured in a New Market Entrant (NME) infrastructure,
and could work with the incumbentâ€™s GPC < 1.6.0.

Adaptor consists of two main components:
- GPC API Facade
- GP2GP Translator

Both are Java Spring Boot applications, released as separate docker images.

## Endpoints

The Patient Switching Adaptor's facade provides two main endpoints for interacting with patient records.

### POST /Patient/$gpc.migratestructuredrecord

The migratestructuredrecord endpoint is the primary endpoint for the adaptor.
This endpoint initiates the electronic health record (EHR) transfer process. 
To use this endpoint, you need to provide:

- TO_ASID : ASID identifier of the losing incumbent
- FROM_ASID : ASID identifier of the winning New Market Entrant (NME)
- TO_ODS : ODS identifier of the losing incumbent
- FROM_ODS : ODS identifier of the winning New Market Entrant (NME)
- ConversationId : A unique GUID for the request. If not provided, the adaptor will generate one and include it in the response headers.
  It must be used for all further calls for the patient's NHS number.

For more details on how to query the losing practice details, see the [requesting site requirements].

[requesting site requirements]: https://nhse-dsic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DCSDCS/pages/12512034968/GP2GP+Requesting+Adaptor#Registration-Process-&-EHR-Request

The endpoint also requires a JSON body that includes the needed patient NHS number.
Request Body Example:

   ```json
   {
      "resourceType": "Parameters",
      "parameter": [
         {
            "name": "patientNHSNumber",
            "valueIdentifier": {
               "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number",
               "value": "{{nhs-number-test-group-8}}"
            }
         },
         {
            "name": "includeFullRecord",
            "part": [
               {
                  "name": "includeSensitiveInfomation",
                  "valueBoolean": true
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

Responds with one of:

1. Initial request: If you successfully configure the endpoint described above and call it, you should receive a 202-accepted response. This means the adaptor has received the request and is making the relevant requests.
2. Polling the request: after receiving a 202 response, we recommend polling the endpoint at regular intervals using an
   increasing call gap strategy until you get a 200 response.
   Each poll can return one of the following responses:
    - 204 No content: this response indicates that we are still processing the requests / waiting for the EHR message response.
    - 200 Success: this response indicates we have successfully received and converted the EHR to JSON; you will also receive the FHIR bundle in the response's body.
      An example of this response can be found within [expectedBundle.json](gp2gp-translator/src/integrationTest/resources/json/expectedBundle.json).
    - 400,404,500,501: The endpoint can return all these possible error codes. These will all provide a detailed error with an operationOutcome JSON model response in the body. This looks like...

      ```json
      {
         "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
         "meta": {
            "profile": [
               "https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1"
            ]
         },
         "issue": [
            {
               "severity": "error",
               "code": "exception",
               "details": {
                  "coding": [
                     {
                        "system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/ValueSet/Spine-ErrorOrWarningCode-1",
                        "code": "PATIENT_NOT_FOUND",
                        "display": "GP2GP - Patient is not registered at the practice"
                     },
                     {
                       "system": "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.17.101",
                       "code": "06",
                       "display": "Patient not at surgery"
                     }
                  ]
               }
            }
         ]
      }
      ```

### POST /$gpc.ack

This endpoint finalizes the EHR transfer process.
If you do not call this endpoint after receiving an EHR from the migratestructuredrecord enpoint, then you risk the losing practise triggering off the manual postal transfer.

Required fields:

- CONVERSATION_ID: ID from the initial request.
- CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE: Status of the EHR integration.
    - ACCEPTED: EHR integration successful.
    - FAILED_TO_INTEGRATE: Error encountered; triggers postal process.

Endpoint calling:

This endpoint is a fire-and-forget endpoint.
- If your request is successful, you will get a 200: Success response.
- If your request is unsuccessful, you will get a 500: Server error response.
- If you receive a 500 response, you can retry again at any point, however, it should be noted that you must receive a 200: Success response from the migratestructuredrecord for the given conversation ID to receive a 200: Success from this endpoint.

## Performance
The performance of PS Adaptor was tested with JMeter tool. 
The use case tested was the simulation of the patient transfer request. 
This was tested by sending EHR record requests to the PS Adaptor, and we expected to receive a bundle back. 
The patient transfer used two attachments,both of them are text attachments of size 2.44 MB and 0.7 MB.
We used these tests to observe how the PS Adaptor handles a heavy workload and to profile the CPU and memory usage 
during the testing process.

There was a series of tests run with the following setup and parameters:
- PS Adaptor was run in ECS AWS environment with 4 CPUs and 16 GB memory.
- MHS Adaptor was run in ECS AWS environment with 4 CPUs and 16 GB memory.
- For the message queue mq.m5.xlarge host type was used
- RDS DB host type was set to db.t3.xlarge

The test used 2000 transfers which were split into 5 batches of 400 transfers.
The time for the test was measured from the start of the initial request to the completion of all transfers.
Pause time between transfers was set to 1 sec and the socket timeout was to 2 minutes.

The test load with 2000 transactions finished successfully in 14 minutes which gives on average 420-435 ms per transfer.
The observed CPU utilization was around 50-60% and memory usage was around 70% which leaves plenty of headroom for additional load.
