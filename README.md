National Integration Adaptor - Switching Standard Adaptor

Incumbent providers (e.g. TPP, EMIS, SystemOne) in order to deploy GP2GP Adaptor in their infrastructure
to support losing practice scenario - i.e. whereby a different practice transfers patient data from the incumbent
would have to make changes to their GP Connect interface implementations.
In particular, they would need to implement 1.6.0 version that is required by the GPC Consumer and GP2GP adaptors. 
This business case is not always easy to be accepted by the incumbent providers, as they would have to invest time to make those changes.

The motivation for the Switching Standard Adaptor is to remove the dependency from incumbent providers to do that work.
The idea is to build an adaptor that could be installed and configured in a New Market Entrant (NME) infrastructure,
and could work with the incumbentâ€™s GPC < 1.6.0.

## Requirements:

* JDK 14 - We develop the adaptor in Java with Spring Boot
